# Analyzer — MVVM & Threading refactor plan

Unified phased plan addressing the findings from the MVVM audit and the
threading audit (run against `analyzer/Plans/threading_model.md`).
The two audits overlap heavily; each phase below is sized to ship as one PR
and fully resolves a named slice of findings.

## Conventions

- **Findings codes:** `MVVM-H1` etc. = the audit ordinal. Each phase lists which
  findings it closes so we can check coverage at the end.
- **"Done"** = code merged to `main`, app launches, manual smoke-test below
  passes, no regression in the path the phase didn't touch.
- **Threading rules** are the non-negotiables in `threading_model.md`. Any
  change in any phase must respect them — even if the phase is nominally
  about MVVM.

---

## Phase 1 — Single source of truth for model state

**Closes:** MVVM-H1, MVVM-H2, Threading-C1.
**Also fixes the user-reported "0 detections / Unknown Species 1473" bug.**

### Problem

`IsModelLoaded` and `ModelPath` are duplicated as `[ObservableProperty]`
fields on `ProcessingViewModel.cs:50` and `SingleAnalysisViewModel.cs:84`,
while the actual state lives on the shared `BirdNetService` instance.
`AppStateService` exists but is only consumed by `SingleAnalysisViewModel`.
The Process tab's local `IsModelLoaded` defaults to `false`, so the user
must click "Load Model…" again — that re-load nulls the labels array on the
shared service, and bulk processing returns `Unknown Species 1473` even
though Single Analysis still shows real names.

### Scope

1. **`AppStateService`** is the canonical owner of `IsModelLoaded` and
   `ModelPath`. (Already declared there — just promote it to the only writer.)
2. **`BirdNetService.LoadModelAsync`** stays the only place that loads a model;
   on success its `await` continuation calls
   `appState.ApplyModelLoaded(path)` on the UI thread (single-writer rule).
3. **`SingleAnalysisViewModel`** removes its local `IsModelLoaded` /
   `ModelPath` `[ObservableProperty]` fields. Properties become read-only
   projections of `AppStateService`. Same for the auto-load flow.
4. **`ProcessingViewModel`** takes `AppStateService` in its constructor.
   Same projection pattern. Local fields removed.
5. **`MainWindowViewModel`** wires `AppStateService` into `ProcessingViewModel`
   the same way it does for `SingleAnalysisViewModel`.
6. **`ProcessingView.axaml`** — "Load Model…" button now hides when the model
   is already loaded (`IsVisible="{Binding !IsModelLoaded}"` already in place,
   just needs to bind to the projected value).
7. **Defensive:** if `BirdNetService.FindLabels` returns null on a load,
   throw a clear `InvalidOperationException("Labels file not found near {modelPath}")`.
   Today it silently sets `_labels = null`, which is exactly the foot-gun that
   produced the user-reported bug.

### Files touched

- `analyzer/Shared/Services/AppStateService.cs` — add `ApplyModelLoaded(path)`.
- `analyzer/Shared/Services/BirdNetService.cs` — throw on null labels;
  callers (the VMs) call `appState.ApplyModelLoaded` on success.
- `analyzer/Shared/ViewModels/SingleAnalysisViewModel.cs` — drop local fields,
  project from `AppStateService`. Update `LoadModelAsync` and
  `TryAutoLoadModelAsync` continuations.
- `analyzer/Shared/ViewModels/ProcessingViewModel.cs` — accept
  `AppStateService`; drop local fields; project; update `LoadModelAsync`.
- `analyzer/Shared/ViewModels/MainWindowViewModel.cs` — pass `appState` into
  `ProcessingViewModel`.
- `analyzer/Shared/Views/ProcessingView.axaml` (verify binding still works
  after the projection rename, no logic change expected).

### Acceptance

- Open app cold → Single Analysis tab shows model loaded → switch to Process
  tab → "Load Model…" button is **hidden**, file list pickers are enabled.
- Run Single File analysis → 4 Bobwhite detections with correct names.
- Without re-loading the model, run Bulk processing on the same file → 4
  Bobwhite detections with correct names.
- Force the failure: pick a model file in a directory with no labels.txt →
  clear error toast / status message; no silent "Unknown Species" later.

### Risk

Low. The change is mostly mechanical (delete two fields, add a projection),
and the defensive labels check fails loudly instead of corrupting state.

---

## Phase 2 — Models implement Model→VM notifications

**Closes:** MVVM-M4 (and fixes the "scroll to see bearings" UX bug).

### Problem

The MS MVVM diagram has two notification flows:

```
View ←→ ViewModel ←→ Model
              (notify)        (notify)
```

`ViewModel → View` notifications work (Toolkit's `[ObservableProperty]` everywhere).
`Model → ViewModel` notifications are **broken across the codebase** — every
mutable model class is a plain POCO with auto-properties, no
`INotifyPropertyChanged`. When a service mutates a model that's already in a
bound collection, the UI doesn't know to refresh. Today's user-visible
symptom: bearings don't appear in the DataGrid until the user scrolls.

### Audit

Out of 9 model files in `Shared/Models/`, only `TrainingClip` is observable.
The rest are POCOs. Of those POCOs:

- **Must become observable** (mutated after binding):
  - `Detection` — `BearingDeg`, `TdoaSamples`, `TdoaConfidence`,
    `LocalizationId`, `IsSelected` all get set after the detection is in
    `ObservableCollection<Detection>`.
- **Should become observable** (probably mutated after binding):
  - `Station` — `RecordingCount` / `LastRecordingTime` update as new audio
    files import. Verify by checking call sites; if confirmed, convert.
- **Verify before converting** (might be POCO-safe):
  - `SurveyConfig` — depends on whether the Population view binds two-way
    to its properties directly or wraps it in a VM. If direct, INPC is
    required for round-tripping.
- **Stay POCO** (no post-binding mutation):
  - `AudioFile` — fully populated by `LoadFileAsync`, then read-only.
  - `Localization` — computed once, replaced if recomputed.
  - `PopulationEstimate` / `DailyCount` / `WeatherData` — read-only results.

### Scope

1. **`Detection`** — convert to `ObservableObject` with `[ObservableProperty]`
   on every mutable field. Computed display properties
   (`DisplayName`, `ConfidencePercent`, `BearingDisplay`) get
   `[NotifyPropertyChangedFor(...)]` annotations on the source backing fields
   so they refresh transitively (`BearingDeg` change → `BearingDisplay`
   notifies).
2. **`Station`** — same conversion, after a quick call-site check confirms
   `RecordingCount`/`LastRecordingTime` are mutated post-binding.
3. **`SurveyConfig`** — check Population view bindings; convert only if
   two-way bound to UI.
4. **Documentation** — add a one-paragraph note to
   `Plans/threading_model.md` (or a new `Plans/mvvm_pattern.md`) clarifying
   the rule: *"any model whose properties mutate after the model is added
   to a bound collection must implement `INotifyPropertyChanged`"*.

### Files touched

- `analyzer/Shared/Models/Detection.cs`
- `analyzer/Shared/Models/Station.cs` (pending verification)
- `analyzer/Shared/Models/SurveyConfig.cs` (pending verification)
- (No ViewModel or View changes expected — bindings remain the same; the
  models just start sending notifications.)

### Acceptance

- Run analysis on a stereo file → bearings appear in the DataGrid
  **immediately**, no scroll needed.
- Toggle a detection's `IsSelected` → UI reflects it without a refresh.
- (If Station converted) Import a new file with a known station → station
  list `RecordingCount` updates without manual refresh.

### Risk

Low. Conversion is mechanical. Watch for serialization compatibility if
any model is JSON-persisted with strict shape expectations
(`PopulationViewModel` import/export uses `Detection`/`Localization` JSON —
verify the converted classes still serialize identically; `[ObservableProperty]`
generates the same getter/setter shape).

---

## Phase 3 — Async I/O discipline

**Closes:** MVVM-H3, MVVM-H4, MVVM-H5, MVVM-H6, Threading-H2, Threading-M2.

### Problem

Three places do synchronous file I/O on the UI thread, and two views call a
static export service from code-behind, bypassing the VM:

- `PopulationViewModel.ExportResults:438` — `File.WriteAllText` sync.
- `PopulationViewModel.ImportPrevious:447` — `File.ReadAllText` sync.
  Both entered from `PopulationView.axaml.cs:54, 78` code-behind.
- `ConfigService.Load:56` and `Save:73` — sync `File.Read/WriteAllText`.
  `Load` runs from `MainWindowViewModel` ctor at startup; `Save` runs from
  `MainWindow.axaml.cs:76` `OnClosing`. Slow disk → hang.
- `SingleAnalysisView.axaml.cs:350-352` and `ProcessingView.axaml.cs:83-85`
  call `DetectionExporter.WriteBirdNetCsv/WriteRavenTable` directly.
  Bypasses VM, no async, no progress, no error surface.

### Scope

1. **`PopulationViewModel`**: `ExportResults` → `ExportResultsCommand` (`async Task`),
   wraps work in `Task.Run`. Same for `ImportPrevious` → `ImportPreviousCommand`.
   `PopulationView.axaml.cs` awaits the command via the file picker code.
2. **`ConfigService`**: add `LoadAsync` / `SaveAsync`. Keep sync `Load` for
   the cold-startup path *only* (acceptable for one-time small JSON), or move
   load into an `InitializeAsync` step on `MainWindowViewModel`. `Save` becomes
   async; `MainWindow.OnClosing` becomes `async void` and `await`s it (this is
   one of the legitimate `async void` cases — UI event handler).
3. **`DetectionExporter` calls in views**: each VM gets an
   `ExportDetectionsCommand(string path)` that wraps the static method in
   `Task.Run` and updates a status property when done. Code-behind picks the
   file, then `await vm.ExportDetectionsCommand.ExecuteAsync(path)`.

### Files touched

- `analyzer/Shared/ViewModels/PopulationViewModel.cs`
- `analyzer/Shared/Views/PopulationView.axaml.cs`
- `analyzer/Shared/Services/ConfigService.cs`
- `analyzer/Shared/ViewModels/MainWindowViewModel.cs` (init flow)
- `analyzer/Shared/Views/MainWindow.axaml.cs` (OnClosing)
- `analyzer/Shared/ViewModels/SingleAnalysisViewModel.cs` (new export command)
- `analyzer/Shared/ViewModels/ProcessingViewModel.cs` (new export command)
- `analyzer/Shared/Views/SingleAnalysisView.axaml.cs` (await command)
- `analyzer/Shared/Views/ProcessingView.axaml.cs` (await command)

### Acceptance

- Export a population JSON in the Population view → status shows progress,
  UI stays responsive while writing.
- Import a population JSON → same.
- Quit the app while a save is pending → window closes after save completes,
  no dropped writes (or background task drains in app shutdown — call out
  whichever we pick).
- Export detections from Single Analysis or Process view → progress, no UI
  freeze on a large CSV.

### Risk

Medium. `OnClosing` becoming `async void` is correct but slightly subtle —
make sure `Avalonia` understands the close should wait. If we hit close-cancel
issues, fallback is sync `Save()` on close (small file, accept the freeze)
and async everywhere else.

---

## Phase 4 — Cancellation discipline

**Closes:** Threading-H3, Threading-M1.

### Problem

Several fire-and-forget async sites have no `CancellationToken` and no way
to drop stale tasks when the user changes their mind:

- `SingleAnalysisViewModel.cs:147` — `_ = TryAutoLoadModelAsync()`.
- `SingleAnalysisViewModel.cs:342, 344, 383` —
  `_ = EstimateNoiseProfileThenRegenerateAsync()`,
  `_ = FullRegenerateSpectrogramAsync()`,
  `_ = RenderSpectrogramFromCacheAsync()`.
  User flipping NR / changing files / playing audio rapidly stacks stale
  spectrogram regenerations.
- `MapViewModel.cs:127–131` — `partial void OnShowStationsChanged(bool) => _ = UpdateLayerVisibilityAsync()`
  (and similar for other filter changes). Toggling a filter five times
  launches five overlapping refreshes.

### Scope

1. Each VM that has fire-and-forget background work owns a `CancellationTokenSource`
   field per logical job kind (auto-load, spectrogram, layer-update). Accept
   per-VM, not a global `_cts` — different jobs cancel independently.
2. Helper extension or local method `Replace(ref CancellationTokenSource? cts)`
   that cancels and disposes the old one and returns a fresh token.
3. Each fire-and-forget call site:
   - cancel and replace the token,
   - pass the token to the async method,
   - swallow `OperationCanceledException`.
4. `Dispose` (or VM's deactivation, where applicable) cancels all in-flight tokens.

### Files touched

- `analyzer/Shared/ViewModels/SingleAnalysisViewModel.cs`
- `analyzer/Shared/ViewModels/MapViewModel.cs`
- (Possibly a small helper in `analyzer/Shared/Services/` —
  `CancellationHelpers.cs` — if the pattern repeats enough.)

### Acceptance

- Toggle NR on/off rapidly → only the latest spectrogram regeneration finishes;
  earlier ones cancel cleanly without UI flicker.
- Toggle map filter checkboxes rapidly → no overlapping refresh; final state
  matches the last toggle.
- Switch files in Single Analysis mid-spectrogram-render → old render
  cancels, new file's render proceeds.

### Risk

Low. `OperationCanceledException` from inside a `_ = ...Async()` was already
unhandled — we're explicit about it now.

---

## Phase 5 — View↔Model decoupling (remaining)

**Closes:** MVVM-M3.
**Reviewed and rejected:** MVVM-M1, MVVM-M2 (rationale below).

### Reviewed and rejected during execution

- **MVVM-M1 — `LocalizationViewModel` mutates `Detection.LocalizationId`
  in a loop.** This is the canonical "ViewModel updates Model" arrow on the
  MS MVVM diagram, made fully reactive after Phase 2 (Detection now sends
  `INotifyPropertyChanged`). The audit suggested extracting to a
  `LocalizationLinkingService` "for traceability," but the loop is right
  there in the VM, easy to read, and the data flow is already observable.
  Extraction would move the same code to another file without changing
  behavior — pure ceremony, not a violation. Closing as no-fix.

- **MVVM-M2 — `SingleAnalysisView.axaml.cs` redraws Canvas labels/markers
  imperatively.** The code-behind only *reads* VM state via subscriptions
  and updates `Canvas.Children` based on the rendered spectrogram bounds;
  it never writes back to models or services. The math fundamentally depends
  on view-side rendered geometry, so refactoring to `ItemsControl` + a
  positioning behavior would still need code-behind glue to feed bounds
  into the VM. Stylistic preference, not a view→model violation. The
  user's stated concern was "views reaching directly into models to change
  states" — this code does not do that. Significant visual-regression risk
  for no concrete fix. Deferred until a concrete need arises (e.g., adding
  hover tooltips or click handling on markers).

### Problem (M3 only)

- `MainWindow.axaml.cs:39–76` — code-behind reads/writes `ConfigService`
  through `vm.ConfigService.WindowWidth = ...` etc., directly mutating
  service state. This **is** "view reaching past the VM into a service" —
  a real instance of the pattern the user is escaping.

### Scope

1. New `LocalizationLinkingService` (or method on an existing service)
   that takes the detections + the localization id and applies the link
   in one place. VM calls the service; service raises an event the VM
   subscribes to.
2. Replace the manual Canvas updates in `SingleAnalysisView.axaml.cs` with
   either:
   - `ItemsControl` over a VM-bound `ObservableCollection<DetectionMarker>`
     with an `ItemsPanel` of `Canvas`, plus a converter for positioning;
     OR
   - A small `AttachedBehavior` that reacts to `INotifyCollectionChanged`
     on a bound collection.
   Pick the simpler one for the use case (probably `ItemsControl`).
3. `MainWindow.axaml.cs` window-geometry persistence:
   - Move `Save()` calls into a `WindowState` service that the VM owns.
   - Code-behind only raises `SaveWindowState` on the relevant events, the
     VM's command does the rest.

### Files touched

- `analyzer/Shared/ViewModels/LocalizationViewModel.cs`
- New `analyzer/Shared/Services/LocalizationLinkingService.cs` (or extend an
  existing one).
- `analyzer/Shared/Views/SingleAnalysisView.axaml(.cs)` — Canvas refactor.
- `analyzer/Shared/ViewModels/MainWindowViewModel.cs` — window-state command.
- `analyzer/Shared/Views/MainWindow.axaml.cs` — drop direct ConfigService
  access; raise commands.

### Acceptance

- Localization linking still works end-to-end; the link is set by the service,
  the VM observes the change, the view updates from binding.
- Detection markers still appear on the spectrogram, with no Canvas update
  code in `SingleAnalysisView.axaml.cs`.
- Resize / move / maximize the window, quit, restart → window state restores.
  Code-behind has no `ConfigService` references.

### Risk

Medium. Canvas refactor can be visually fiddly (positioning math moves into
a converter). Plan to take screenshots before/after to verify no regression.

---

## Phase 6 — Cleanup

**Closes:** MVVM-L1, MVVM-L2.

### Scope

1. Move `HalfValueConverter` from
   `analyzer/Shared/ViewModels/SingleAnalysisViewModel.cs:503–519` to
   `analyzer/Shared/Converters/HalfValueConverter.cs`. Update XAML namespaces.
2. Introduce a DI container (`Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection`)
   in `Desktop/Program.cs` and `analyzer/Shared/App.axaml.cs`. Register all
   services as singletons (they currently are — just `new`'d in `MainWindowViewModel`).
   `MainWindowViewModel`'s no-arg ctor goes away; the DI container resolves
   it. Optional but unlocks unit-testable VMs.

### Files touched

- `analyzer/Shared/Converters/HalfValueConverter.cs` (new).
- `analyzer/Shared/ViewModels/SingleAnalysisViewModel.cs` (removed converter).
- `analyzer/Shared/Views/*.axaml` (namespace import update).
- `analyzer/Desktop/Program.cs` — DI bootstrap.
- `analyzer/Shared/App.axaml.cs` — resolve `MainWindow` from container.

### Acceptance

- App starts identically; nothing functional changed.
- Adding a unit test for `MainWindowViewModel` is now possible (write one
  trivial test as proof; doesn't have to land in this PR).

### Risk

Low. Pure refactor. DI part can be deferred if we don't want test plumbing yet.

---

## Order and sequencing

**Recommended:** 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 5 → 6.

- Phase 1 (DONE) — single source of truth for service state.
- Phase 2 — Model→VM notifications. Foundational architecture; closes a
  whole class of subtle staleness bugs (the bearing-scroll one being the
  reported example).
- Phase 3 — async I/O. Independent of 2.
- Phase 4 — cancellation. Independent of 2 and 3.
- Phase 5 — view↔model decoupling. Reads cleaner after Phase 2 lands
  (LocalizationVM mutation loops are simpler against observable detections).
- Phase 6 — cleanup. Anytime.
